Question 1,2,1b,Completely incorrect,$\beta_1$ is the expected change in the response for a one unit increase in the explanatory variable.,2
Question 1,NA,1c,Didn't mention difference in x,This is the expected change in the response for a difference in the explanatory value of one unit.,1
Question 2,2,1a,X and Y switched,The explanatory variable is the high school gpa and the response is the first-year college gpa.,0.75
Question 2,NA,1b,No axis labels,There are no axis labels on the plot so it is unclear what is plotted.,0.25
Question 2,NA,1d,Incorrect plot type,The response and explanatory variables are both quantitative variables so a scatterplot is the appropriate plot to show their relationship.,1
Question 3,2,1a,X and Y switched,The explanatory variable is the high school gpa and the response is the first-year college gpa. So the model formula would be specified as: fy_gpa ~ hs_gpa,1
Question 3,NA,1b,Model not save correctly,"The quiz asks that the model be saved as ""model_h"".",0.5
Question 3.a,3,1a,Missed linearity,Simple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.,0.5
Question 3.a,NA,1b,Missed constant variance,Simple linear regression assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant for all values of the explanatory variable.,0.5
Question 3.a,NA,1c,Missed normality,Simple linear regression assumes the residuals are normally distributed.,0.5
Question 3.a,NA,2,Conclusions not fully supported,Your conclusions were not fully supported. For each conclusion there should be a refernce to evidence.,0.75
Question 3.a,NA,3,Did not support conclusions at all,Evidence was not provided to support your conclusions.,1.5
Question 3.b,3,1,Incorrect value identified as slope,The slope of the regression is 0.74314. This can be obtained from the coefficients table from the regression summary.,1
Question 3.b,NA,2,Causal interpretation,"Be careful, we cannot make a causal conclusion here. A correct interpretation of the slope would be: For people with high school GPA differing by one point, we estimate those with the higher GPA to have a first-year college GPA 0.74 points higher, on average.",1
Question 3.b,3,1a,No slope identified,The slope of the regression was not identified.,1
Question 3.b,3,2a,Interpreation not in context,The interpretation was not in the context of this problem. When summarizing findings we want to avoid statistical jargon and present the analysis findings in context.,1
all_questions,NA,0,Correct,You're answer is correct!,0
all_questions,NA,404,Answer missing,No answer was provided for this question.,100
general_feedback,NA,0,Great job on the quiz!,Great job on the quiz! You have a great understanding of the material.,NA
general_feedback,NA,2,Don't just print output,Please make sure to not just print r output. As statisticians we should convey our findings as clearly as possible.,NA
